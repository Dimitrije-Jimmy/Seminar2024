## Seminar 2024

This repository contains the final version of my thesis paper and presentation from my 2024 seminar. The version in Slovenian and the accompanying PowerPoint presentation were originally created for my college seminar, with an English translation added later.

## Abstract

In this seminar, we explore the use of diffusion models in high-energy physics simulations, focusing on their increasing importance as alternatives to traditional Monte Carlo methods, particularly in the context of particle collisions and interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our research aims to elucidate the theoretical foundations and practical implications of diffusion models, demonstrating their potential to advance our understanding of fundamental physical phenomena and expand the frontiers of scientific exploration. We conclude with a detailed study showcasing the application of a diffusion model in simulating particle showers within a calorimeter detector.

## Introduction

The primary intent of this seminar paper is to provide a comprehensive meta-analysis of existing research on diffusion models and their applications in high-energy physics. Over the course of three weeks, I rigorously studied more than 70 research papers, starting from the basics of machine learning and generative AI, and progressing to an in-depth understanding of diffusion models and their specific use cases in high-energy physics. This intense period of research allowed me to synthesize the knowledge required to present the topic effectively to my classmates.

This seminar is part of a broader effort where each student in the class selected and thoroughly researched a specific topic, culminating in a 45-minute presentation. While none of the papers used in this research are my own, the seminar serves as an accessible entry point into the topic for my fellow peers.

For those who are interested in learning more about diffusion models or have questions about the seminar, please feel free to reach out to me at dimitrije.pesic350@gmail.com.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to:
* My mentor, for advising me on the topic of generative machine learning and guiding me in the right direction throughout this process.
* The numerous researchers whose published works provided the foundation for my understanding, enabling me to learn the field within a month of intensive study.

## Spodbuda za soštudente FMF

Drage kolegice in kolegi, čeprav je bila priprava tega seminarja zahteven proces, sem želel z njim predvsem približati temo difuzijskih modelov v fiziki visokih energij. Tri neprespane dni (64 ur to be precise), ki sem jih preživel ob pisanju seminarja od začetka do konca (da se :) ), so mi omogočila globoko razumevanje tematike, ki bi jo rad delil z vami. Če imate kakršnakoli vprašanja ali potrebujete nasvet pri svojem raziskovalnem delu, me lahko kontaktirate na moj e-naslov dimitrije.pesic350@gmail.com. Srečno! Pa ne se bat, sem videl osupljive in tudi obupne seminarje, šanse so da vaš ni tako slab, samo napisati ga je treba. Sam ne ga delat v `Wordu` ._.

P.S.: Prilagam tudi `.tex` file, če sem vam dopade oblikovanje in ga želite rekreirati.
